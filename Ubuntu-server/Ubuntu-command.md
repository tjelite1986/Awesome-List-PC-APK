# Linux Commands Every Ubuntu User Should Know
1. ls command: List the contents of a folder
This is among the first few commands a new Linux user learns. This command lets you see what files and folders are in your current folder.   
`ls`    
You can use the long listing option ls -l to see details like file size, permission, modified time, etc. You can sort and control these options if you want to.    
`ls -l`
